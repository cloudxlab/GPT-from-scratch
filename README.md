# GPT-from-scratch

This project is a TensorFlow implementation of Andrej Karpathy's ng-video-lecture project, which can be found at the original link: [ng-video-lecture](https://github.com/karpathy/ng-video-lecture/blob/master).

## About the Project

Andrej Karpathy's invaluable resource, guiding the process of coding GPT from the ground up and enabling it to generate text reminiscent of Shakespeare, serves as an excellent learning tool for delving into natural language processing and machine learning models. This TensorFlow implementation aims to replicate the functionality of the original project while utilizing the TensorFlow framework.
